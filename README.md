Computer science is an integral part of the modern world. It helps us to use technology, process information, solve complex problems and ensure data security. Knowledge of informatics is necessary for successful functioning in modern society and is one of the key competencies.

Even when people did not talk about graphic design and there was no such concept, they encountered it almost daily - whether it was a newspaper layout, a poster on the wall, a picture on a matchbox, an inscription on a bag of gingerbread or the cover of a favorite book.

People perceive most information visually, and this is why graphic design is very important. It helps to convey the idea and visually show various processes, causes an emotional reaction and promotes decision-making. It is actively used not only in advertising, marketing, and PR. Schemes in a textbook is one of the ways to improve the assimilation of material, layout of a newspaper or magazine plays its role in the interest of the audience. And now, when there is a lot of information and competition is high, to attract attention without quality visual content is almost unrealistic. That's why graphic design is so important. After all, it's how most ideas become a reality.

Before I began working on the code base for this project, I decided on what object would form my scene. I wanted the objects to be challenging yet achievable. Also, I needed to make sure those objects could be replicated with basic 3D shapes. 

Once I began coding, I immediately realized that the code would be lengthy. Thus, I did my best to make the code modular and to utilize extensive yet concise commenting. I also ensured that I used consistent indentation and naming style throughout all pieces of code. 

The great majority of the concepts involved in this project were completely new to me as I had never dealt with graphic design in the past. However, I was able to grasp the material and achieve my goals withing the required timeframe. I learnt how to render basic 3D shapes, how to use them to create 3D objects, to apply textures and lightning, and to program material properties. All the concepts that had to do with positioning objects and light sources were based on the concepts I had previously learnt in Applied Liner Algebra. 

The most fascinating aspect of graphic design is the constant change, evolution and as technology advances, methodologies, approaches, and tools for designers change, new opportunities become available. The future of design will be more innovative and dynamic than before.

In recent years, the main trend is the application of augmented reality in design. AR makes it possible to design interactive experiences that combine digital components with the real world. This opens up new opportunities for brands to connect creatively with their target audience.
